                            Senku Ishigami (石いし神がみ千せん空くう Ishigami Senkū) is the main protagonist of Dr. Stone, and is friends with Taiju 
                            Oki and Yuzuriha Ogawa. He was depetrified half a year before Taiju was, and eventually created the Revival Fluid with 
                            Taiju's help. In the Stone World, Senku's goal is to rebuild civilization and establish a Kingdom of Science.

                            As the first-prize champion in the Grand Bout, Senku currently holds the title of Village Chief in Ishigami Village,
                            where he is widely regarded as a legend thanks to the late Byakuya's influence in the founding of Ishigami Village.

                            Senku is also the leader of the Kingdom of Science, providing the ideas and initiative for their large scale plans. 
                            Later, he is given another title as one of the Five Wise Commanders as he was one of the five people on the boat who 
                            first heard Whyman's message.
